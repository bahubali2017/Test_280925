ðŸ“‹ AGENT PROMPT â€” Update DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md with Phase 10 (with Subphases)

Goal
Update docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md by appending a new Phase 10: Deployment Readiness & CI/CD section, including detailed tasks and subphases 10.1 and 10.2. Maintain formatting consistency with previous phases (checkboxes, âœ… markers when completed).

ðŸ”§ Instructions for the Agent:

Locate docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md.

Append the following new section after Phase 9:

Phase 10: Deployment Readiness & CI/CD

The objective of this phase is to prepare the MVP and Admin Dashboard for staging/production deployment with robust CI/CD pipelines, secure configuration, and validated rollout.

Phase 10.1: CI/CD Setup

 Repository Preparation

Create separate GitHub repositories for:

anamnesis-mvp (MVP app)

anamnesis-admin (Admin Dashboard)

Add .gitignore (exclude node_modules, dist, build, and .env* files)

Push current Replit workspace to GitHub

 Secrets Management

Configure GitHub Actions secrets:

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY

ADMIN_API_TOKEN

 CI/CD Workflow Configuration

Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml for both repos

Steps:

Install dependencies (npm ci)

Run ESLint & TypeScript validation

Run test suites

Build project (npm run build)

Deploy to staging (Vercel/Netlify/Fly.io/other)

 Deployment Targets

Configure DNS + SSL for:

MVP â†’ app.anamnesis.health

Admin Dashboard â†’ admin.anamnesis.health

API â†’ api.anamnesis.health

Phase 10.2: Deployment Validation

 Staging Validation

Deploy MVP to staging.anamnesis.health

Deploy Admin Dashboard to staging-admin.anamnesis.health

Validate:

Authentication (email/password + OAuth)

AI streaming + Stop AI abort (<1s)

Admin Dashboard WebSocket monitoring

Legal pages (/legal) load correctly

 Security Validation

Confirm Code Protection Layer (CORS, headers, obfuscation, watermarking)

Validate HTTPS enforcement & SSL certs

Test rate limiting and honeypot detection

 Production Rollout

Promote staging builds to production

Confirm DNS + SSL are live

Run smoke tests on production endpoints

Validate performance and logging in production (Sentry/Logtail if configured)

 Final Documentation

Update DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md â†’ Mark Phase 10.1 and 10.2 completed

Add RELEASE_NOTES.md with features, fixes, and deployment notes

Archive CI/CD logs for traceability

Keep Phase 10 aligned with earlier phases in terms of formatting, indentation, and âœ… task style.

Do not overwrite previous content; only append Phase 10.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md updated with Phase 10: Deployment Readiness & CI/CD, containing subphases 10.1 (CI/CD Setup) and 10.2 (Deployment Validation) fully detailed.
