üü¢ Agent Prompt ‚Äî Fix client/src/lib/medical-layer/fallback-engine.js

You are tasked with eliminating all TypeScript strict mode errors and ESLint issues from
client/src/lib/medical-layer/fallback-engine.js. Follow these instructions exactly:

1. Validation & Reference Check

Confirm all imports, exports, and function references are correct.

Ensure fallback-engine.js is actively used:

Search across client/src/ for fallback-engine references.

Check medical-layer integration files (atd-router.js, triage-engine.js, medical-safety-processor.js, etc.) to ensure this module is referenced.

Report dependencies clearly before applying changes.

2. Refactor & Error Fixing

Fix all TypeScript strict mode errors (tsc --noEmit --strict --allowJs --checkJs) in this file.

Fix all ESLint errors/warnings.

Do not introduce suppressions (// @ts-ignore, eslint-disable, any, etc.).

All added JSDoc typedefs and function signatures are templates ‚Äî adjust them to match the actual code. Never introduce mismatches.

3. Typedef & Type Safety

Add complete JSDoc typedefs for all medical safety fallback structures:

FallbackResponse, FallbackReason, FallbackEngineOptions, FallbackEngineResult, SafetyMetadata (adjust to actual code).

Replace unsafe object access with null checks and type guards.

Ensure all accumulators, arrays, and maps have explicit element typing.

Add proper function parameter and return type annotations.

4. Medical Safety Integrity

Preserve and validate the fallback logic:

Emergency detection fallbacks must remain intact.

Ensure ATD (Advice-to-Doctor) routing still works.

Preserve disclaimer insertion and privacy protections.

If the fallback engine connects to medical-safety-processor, emergency-detector, or triage-engine, ensure compatibility with their fixed typedefs.

5. Logging & Error Handling

Replace raw console.log calls with structured logging (console.info, console.warn, console.error).

Wrap unsafe code in try/catch blocks with proper instanceof Error checks.

Preserve audit trail logging required for medical compliance.

6. Post-Refactor Validation

Run TypeScript check again ‚Äî file must report 0 errors.

Run ESLint check again ‚Äî file must report 0 warnings/errors.

Confirm runtime functionality is preserved:

Fallbacks trigger properly when primary safety checks fail.

Emergency and disclaimer handling remain intact.

7. Documentation Update

Update TS_ERROR_MASTER_AUDIT_v2.md:

Mark fallback-engine.js as ‚úÖ FIXED.

Adjust error/file counts accordingly.

Add changelog note summarizing fixes.

‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: All typedefs and annotations are templates. Adjust them to exactly match the actual implementation in fallback-engine.js. Never leave placeholders or mismatched documentation.
