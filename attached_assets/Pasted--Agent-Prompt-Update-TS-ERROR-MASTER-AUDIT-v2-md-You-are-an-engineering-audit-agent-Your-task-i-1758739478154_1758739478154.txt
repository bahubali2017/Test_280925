üîπ Agent Prompt ‚Äî Update TS_ERROR_MASTER_AUDIT_v2.md
You are an engineering audit agent. Your task is to update the file 
`TS_ERROR_MASTER_AUDIT_v2.md` to reflect the current TypeScript strict mode + ESLint error status. 
Do not invent fixes ‚Äî only update tracking.

Instructions:
1. Update all Tier 1 files (Critical Core Files - LIVE) to ‚úÖ FIXED (0 errors).
   These are:
   - client/src/analytics/analytics-utils.js
   - client/src/analytics/usage-tracker.js
   - client/src/analytics/improvement-suggester.js
   - client/src/lib/medical-layer/atd-router.js
   - client/src/tests/qa/test-executor.js
   - client/src/analytics/metadata-logger.js
   - client/src/qa/version-tracker.js
   - client/src/tests/qa/regression-runner.js
   - client/src/lib/llm-integration/llm-preference-engine.js
   - client/src/qa/qa.test.js
   - client/src/lib/llm-api.jsx
   - client/src/lib/medical-safety-processor.js
   - client/src/lib/medical-layer/emergency-detector.js
   - client/src/lib/optimization/performance-tuner.js

2. Remove their error counts from the global "Found ### errors in ### files" summary.
   Adjust the total from **670 errors in 81 files** down by the sum of Tier 1 fixed errors 
   (approx. 352+59+39+35+33+24+26+23+19+18 = ~628). 
   Recalculate new totals.

3. Re-organize the remaining error table by:
   - Highest error count at the top.
   - ‚úÖ Mark all fixed files with ‚Äú(Fixed - 0 errors)‚Äù and move them into a separate 
     "Resolved Tier 1 Files" section at the bottom.

4. Update progress summary:
   - Show original totals vs current.
   - Show % completion (files + errors).

5. Keep formatting identical to the original audit file, just updated.
   Use clear markdown sections:
   - `# TS_ERROR_MASTER_AUDIT_v2`
   - `## Current Status`
   - `## Remaining Files with Errors`
   - `## Resolved Tier 1 Files`
   - `## Progress Summary`

Goal: The document must be ready as the **new master audit index** for the next phase of fixes.

i attached the current TS errors - you will need to also the Eslint errors for each files
