Full Technical Report: Streaming Response & Stop AI Button Issues
Current Status: STREAMING RECEPTION BROKEN
üî¥ Primary Issue
Client-side streaming is completely broken - AI responses stay stuck on "pending" status for 26+ seconds, then receive the entire response at once instead of streaming incrementally.

‚úÖ What Actually Works
Server-side streaming: Perfect 26+ second streams with proper SSE formatting
Stop AI button: Clicks register correctly and cancel active streams
Message delivery: Complete responses eventually arrive
Session management: Proper session tracking and cleanup
Rate limiting bypass: Chat endpoints work without throttling
‚ùå What's Broken
Client streaming reception: No incremental updates during streaming
Real-time UI updates: Messages stay "pending" for entire duration
User experience: No visible progress during long AI responses
Technical Evidence from Logs
Server-Side (Working Perfectly)

[SESSION-TRACKER] Updated session: 1 messages, avg latency 23735ms
Client-Side (Broken)

Stop AI Button (Working)

Previous Unsuccessful Fix Attempts
1. Service Worker Removal ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL
Problem: Infinite reload loops causing rate limit cascades
Solution: Completely removed service worker code and files
Result: Fixed infinite loops and rate limiting issues
2. Stop AI Button Visibility ‚ùå FAILED
Attempt: Added complex visibility conditions and sessionId coordination
Problem: Button wasn't rendering due to JavaScript ReferenceError
Result: Fixed rendering but streaming still broken
3. JavaScript Syntax Fixes ‚úÖ PARTIAL SUCCESS
Problem: ReferenceError: onStopAI is not defined in MessageBubble
Fix: Corrected prop passing and function definitions
Result: Button renders and clicks work, but streaming reception unchanged
4. Import Deduplication ‚ùå NO IMPACT
Attempt: Fixed duplicate imports and module conflicts
Result: Cleaner code but no streaming improvement
5. Placeholder Message Approach ‚ùå FAILED
Attempt: Show placeholder message immediately when streaming starts
Problem: Didn't address core streaming reception issue
Result: UI showed placeholder but no incremental updates
6. Session Coordination ‚ùå NO IMPACT
Attempt: Better sessionId tracking between client and server
Result: Sessions tracked correctly but streaming still broken
Root Cause Analysis
The Streaming Pipeline Breakdown
Server: ‚úÖ Generates proper SSE format with event: chunk and data: lines
Network: ‚úÖ Data transmitted correctly (confirmed in server logs)
Client Reception: ‚ùå BROKEN HERE - handleStreamingResponse not processing chunks
UI Updates: ‚ùå onStreamingUpdate never called during streaming
Technical Issue in llm-api.jsx
The handleStreamingResponse function has a critical flaw in the SSE processing logic:

// This code exists but isn't working:
if (currentEvent === 'chunk' && data.text) {
  accumulatedText += data.text;
  onStreamingUpdate(accumulatedText, { 
    isStreaming: true, 
    isComplete: false,
    chunkReceived: true
  });
}
The client-side streaming parser is not correctly:

Processing SSE event types (event: chunk)
Parsing incremental data chunks
Triggering onStreamingUpdate callbacks during streaming
Managing the text accumulation properly
Why Stop AI Works But Streaming Doesn't
The Stop AI button works because:

It operates on message state management (React state)
Uses AbortController for network cancellation
Doesn't depend on SSE chunk processing
Streaming fails because:

SSE chunk processing logic is broken
Client never receives incremental updates during the stream
Only gets the complete response when server sends final metadata
Impact Assessment
User Experience
‚ùå No visual feedback during 26+ second AI responses
‚ùå Appears "frozen" or "broken" to users
‚ùå Wastes credits when users think it's not working
‚úÖ Stop AI button functional when found and clicked
System Functionality
‚úÖ Server streaming infrastructure works perfectly
‚úÖ Message delivery and storage working
‚úÖ Session management and tracking operational
‚ùå Real-time user interface completely broken
Financial Impact
Wasted API credits when users retry "stuck" requests
Poor user experience leading to abandonment
Support burden from confused users
