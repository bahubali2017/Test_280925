GOAL: Fix the corrupted export structure in client/src/lib/llm-api.jsx that prevents the MVP from building, while preserving all existing business logic (medical safety, ATD, admin integration).

TASKS:
1. Locate corruption in llm-api.jsx
   - Open client/src/lib/llm-api.jsx around lines 1570–1590.
   - Verify if any functions (`sendMessage`, `sendMessageWithSafety`, `getSafeTimeoutFunctions`, etc.) are missing closing braces `}`.
   - Ensure no export statements exist inside function bodies or conditional blocks.

2. Correct file structure
   - Add missing closing braces to properly terminate any open function or object definitions.
   - Move the final export block to the bottom of the file at the top-level scope:

     ```js
     // Export all necessary functions for the medical AI system
     export {
       sendMessage,
       sendMessageWithSafety,
       getSafeTimeoutFunctions,
       /* include all other core functions */
     };
     ```

   - Ensure the export block is outside of any functions or callbacks.

3. Verify no duplicate exports
   - Check that none of the functions are already exported inline (`export function …`).
   - If inline exports exist, remove duplicates from the final block.

4. Preserve medical & admin functionality
   - Do NOT remove or refactor medical processing, triage, ATD, safety validation, or admin WebSocket code.
   - Only adjust braces and export placement.

5. Run integrity checks
   - Run `npm run build` → verify Vite completes without syntax errors.
   - Run `npm run dev` → confirm frontend initializes normally.
   - Test AI chat flow to confirm:
     ✅ AI responses stream correctly  
     ✅ “Stop AI” works instantly  
     ✅ Follow-up suggestions appear  
     ✅ Admin dashboard `/api/ai/stats` still works

6. Document fix
   - Update docs/BUILD_FIX_LOG.md with:
     - Root cause (export inside incomplete block)  
     - Exact fix (closing braces + top-level export)  
     - Verification steps & test results
