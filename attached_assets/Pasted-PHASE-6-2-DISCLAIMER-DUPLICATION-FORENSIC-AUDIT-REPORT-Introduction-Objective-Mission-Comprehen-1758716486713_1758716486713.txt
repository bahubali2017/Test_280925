PHASE 6.2 DISCLAIMER DUPLICATION FORENSIC AUDIT REPORT
Introduction & Objective
Mission: Comprehensive forensic audit of disclaimer duplication for the query: "what is the dosage of aspirin?"

Evidence of Problem: Screenshot from user showing identical disclaimer blocks appearing twice:

Block 1: "Symptoms described appear non-urgent based on limited information. This assistant is informational and not a diagnostic tool. Responses may include general medical information and should not replace a professional evaluation."
Block 2: Exact same text repeated
Audit Goal: Identify the precise source of duplication through systematic tracing across all disclaimer injection points.

Disclaimer Injection Architecture Map
1. Primary Source: client/src/lib/disclaimers.js
Function: selectDisclaimers(level, symptomNames)
Role: Single source of truth for disclaimer generation
For non_urgent + medication: Returns 3 disclaimers:
"Symptoms described appear non-urgent based on limited information."
"This assistant is informational and not a diagnostic tool."
"Responses may include general medical information and should not replace a professional evaluation."
2. Consumer Points (Potential Duplication Sources):
A. client/src/lib/prompt-enhancer.js
Function: buildConciseMedicationPrompt()
Action: Calls selectDisclaimers('non_urgent', ['medication'])
Returns: { systemPrompt, disclaimers, atdNotices, responseMode, questionType }
Risk: Primary legitimate use - should be the ONLY source
B. client/src/lib/router.js
Function: routeMedicalQuery()
Current State: FIXED - Sets disclaimers: [] (empty array)
Risk: Previously was passing through disclaimers from enhancer
C. client/src/lib/medical-layer/fallback-engine.js
Function: generateFallbackResponse()
Action: May call selectDisclaimers('non_urgent') if no existing disclaimers
Risk: Could generate duplicate disclaimers if called incorrectly
D. client/src/components/MessageBubble.jsx
Function: UI rendering with dedupeDisclaimers()
Action: Renders metadata.queryIntent.disclaimers after deduplication
Risk: Deduplication may be failing or metadata may contain duplicates
E. server/routes.js
Action: Processes systemPrompt from client
Risk: Server could be injecting additional disclaimers in response processing
Comprehensive Tracing System Deployed
Debug Logs Added:
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] selectDisclaimers - Central generation point
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] enhancer disclaimers - Prompt enhancer injection
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] router setting disclaimers to: [] - Router bypass confirmation
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] fallback disclaimerPack - Fallback engine activity
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] server finalSystemPrompt length - Server processing
[DISCLAIMER_FINAL] UI rendering disclaimers - Final UI metadata before render
Flow Trace Analysis
Expected Normal Flow:
User Query: "what is the dosage of aspirin?"
Router: Calls enhancePrompt() → gets disclaimers but sets disclaimers: []
Prompt Enhancer: Calls selectDisclaimers('non_urgent', ['medication']) → returns 3 disclaimers
SystemPrompt: Contains disclaimers embedded (this was the bug)
Server: Receives systemPrompt with embedded disclaimers
AI Response: Previously included disclaimers in text (FIXED)
UI: Also renders disclaimers from metadata (separate source)
Root Cause Hypothesis:
DUAL DISCLAIMER INJECTION CONFIRMED:

Source 1: SystemPrompt Embedding (FIXED)
Location: buildConciseMedicationPrompt() line 228
Problem: Always end with: ${baseDisclaimer} instructed AI to embed disclaimers
Fix Applied: Removed embedded disclaimer instruction
Status: SHOULD BE FIXED
Source 2: Metadata Passing (POTENTIAL ONGOING ISSUE)
Location: Metadata flow from enhancer → router → server → client
Problem: Router was passing disclaimers despite setting empty array
Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION
Evidence Logs Analysis
From Previous Test (Build timestamp: 1758714205252):
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] server finalSystemPrompt length: 1199 chars
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] server role: public enhancedPrompt available: true
[PROMPT_SOURCE] CLIENT
Missing Evidence (Need Fresh Test):
No [DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] selectDisclaimers calls logged
No [DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] enhancer disclaimers generation logs
No [DISCLAIMER_FINAL] UI rendering evidence
Conclusion: Previous build may not have included all debug code
Suspected Root Cause
HYPOTHESIS: METADATA DUPLICATION IN SERVER PROCESSING

The duplication appears to occur because:

SystemPrompt contains disclaimers (from enhancer)
Metadata ALSO contains disclaimers (separate path)
UI renders metadata disclaimers independently of AI response
Result: Same disclaimers appear twice - once from AI response content, once from UI metadata
Critical Investigation Points:
1. Server Response Metadata
server/routes.js may be attaching disclaimers to response metadata
Need to verify: Does server extract disclaimers from systemPrompt and add to metadata?
2. Client Metadata Handling
Does client receive disclaimers in BOTH response content AND metadata?
Is dedupeDisclaimers() working correctly?
3. Router Disclaimer Bypass
Is router fix actually working? (disclaimers: [])
Could disclaimers still be passed through other paths?
Proposed Fix Strategy
Phase 1: Verification Test
Run aspirin query with full debug logging
Capture complete trace from selectDisclaimers → UI render
Identify exact duplication point
Phase 2: Metadata Source Investigation
Trace how disclaimers get into metadata.queryIntent.disclaimers
Check if server is adding disclaimers to response metadata
Verify router fix is actually preventing disclaimer pass-through
Phase 3: Final Fix
Based on evidence:

If server metadata injection: Remove server disclaimer attachment
If UI deduplication failure: Fix dedupeDisclaimers logic
If router bypass failure: Strengthen router disclaimer blocking
Verification Plan
Test Protocol:
Query: "what is the dosage of aspirin?"

Expected Debug Output:

[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] selectDisclaimers called with level: non_urgent symptoms: 1
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] enhancer disclaimers: 3 items: [Symptoms described appear..., This assistant is informational..., Responses may include general...]
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] router setting disclaimers to: [] (empty array)
[DISCLAIMER_DEBUG] server finalSystemPrompt length: XXXX chars
[DISCLAIMER_FINAL] UI rendering disclaimers - original: X deduped: Y
Success Criteria:

Only ONE disclaimer block visible in UI
Debug logs show single selectDisclaimers call
UI deduplication shows original:3, deduped:3 (no duplicates)
Expected Resolution:
Single disclaimer block with 3 lines:

"Symptoms described appear non-urgent based on limited information."
"This assistant is informational and not a diagnostic tool."
"Responses may include general medical information and should not replace a professional evaluation."
Status: PENDING VERIFICATION TEST
Next Action Required: Run aspirin query to capture full forensic trace and identify exact duplication source with deployed tracing system.
