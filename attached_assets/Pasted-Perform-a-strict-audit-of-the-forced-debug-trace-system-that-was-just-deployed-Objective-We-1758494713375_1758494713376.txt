Perform a strict audit of the forced debug trace system that was just deployed.

üéØ Objective:
We must confirm why "aspirin dosage" is still producing a long expanded response instead of the short 3‚Äì5 sentence concise response.

‚úÖ Required Actions:
1. Debug Trace Verification
   - Capture all [TRACE] console logs during a "what is the dosage of aspirin?" request.
   - Confirm the following sequence is firing:
     [TRACE] classifyQuestionType -> { questionType: "medication" }
     [TRACE] buildPromptsForQuery -> { mode: "concise" }
     [TRACE] systemPrompt(head) -> preview text (should show concise-only instructions)
   - Report whether systemPrompt contains forbidden words: "side effects", "interactions", "expand".

2. Medication Concise Prompt Enforcement
   - Open buildConciseMedicationPrompt() in prompt-enhancer.js.
   - Ensure the following rules are strictly enforced:
     ‚Ä¢ Max 3‚Äì5 sentences only
     ‚Ä¢ Only dosage units and frequency (81 mg daily, 325 mg as needed)
     ‚Ä¢ Explicit line: "Do NOT expand, explain, or include side effects"
     ‚Ä¢ Return concise string without fallback to expansion-prompts.js
   - Confirm this specialized prompt is being routed in buildPromptsForQuery().

3. Expansion Contamination Check
   - Search the entire client/src/lib directory for any occurrence of:
     ‚Äúexpand‚Äù, ‚Äúside effects‚Äù, ‚Äúprecaution‚Äù, ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù
   - Verify none of these appear in the systemPrompt for medication queries.
   - If found, remove or quarantine them in UI-only expansion-prompts.js.

4. STOP AI Flow Audit
   - Confirm that on stop:
     ‚Ä¢ Disclaimers are NOT re-injected
     ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAI stopped by user‚Äù message appears in MessageBubble.jsx
   - Add debug log [STOP] confirming disclaimers cleared.

5. Deployment
   - Rebuild clean: rm -rf dist && npm run build
   - Report:
     ‚Ä¢ New bundle hash
     ‚Ä¢ Build timestamp
     ‚Ä¢ Console log sequence for ‚Äúaspirin dosage‚Äù

üìã Deliverable:
A technical report with:
- Debug log sequence for aspirin dosage
- Extract of systemPrompt (first 400 chars)
- Confirmation whether concise mode rules are applied
- Confirmation STOP AI flow works cleanly
- Confirmation no duplicate disclaimers
- Final bundle hash + timestamp
