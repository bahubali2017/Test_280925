What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?
Definition:
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder. It affects the large intestine (colon) and involves a group of symptoms that occur together without visible signs of damage or disease in the digestive tract. It is not life-threatening but can significantly impact quality of life.

Key Features of IBS
1. Symptoms
IBS is characterized by a combination of abdominal discomfort and altered bowel habits. Common symptoms include:
• Abdominal pain or cramping, often relieved by passing stool or gas.
• Bloating and a feeling of fullness.
• Changes in bowel movements, which may include:
• Diarrhea (IBS-D)
• Constipation (IBS-C)
• Alternating diarrhea and constipation (IBS-Mixed)
• Mucus in the stool.
• Urgency to have a bowel movement or a sensation of incomplete evacuation.
Symptoms often fluctuate in severity and may be triggered by stress, certain foods, or hormonal changes.
2. Causes and Triggers
The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but several factors are believed to contribute:
• Abnormal gut motility: The muscles of the colon may contract too strongly or weakly.
• Visceral hypersensitivity: Increased sensitivity to pain or discomfort in the intestines.
• Gut-brain axis dysfunction: Miscommunication between the brain and the digestive system.
• Microbiome imbalance: Changes in the types or numbers of gut bacteria.
• Triggers: Common triggers include certain foods (e.g., dairy, caffeine, high-fat foods), stress, infections, or hormonal changes (e.g., during menstruation).
3. Diagnosis
IBS is typically diagnosed based on symptoms, as there is no specific test for it. Healthcare providers often use criteria such as the Rome IV criteria (recurrent abdominal pain at least once per week for 3 months, associated with changes in bowel habits). Tests may be done to rule out other conditions, such as:
• Blood tests
• Stool tests
• Colonoscopy (in some cases)

Management Overview
Managing IBS focuses on relieving symptoms and improving daily function. Approaches are often individualized:
1. Dietary Modifications
• Identify trigger foods: Common culprits include spicy foods, dairy, caffeine, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners.
• High-fiber diet: For constipation-predominant IBS, increasing soluble fiber (e.g., oats, fruits) may help.
• Low FODMAP diet: A temporary elimination diet that reduces fermentable carbohydrates (e.g., onions, garlic, beans) under guidance from a dietitian.
• Adequate hydration: Important for managing both diarrhea and constipation.
2. Lifestyle Changes
• Stress management: Techniques like mindfulness, yoga, meditation, or counseling can reduce symptom flare-ups.
• Regular exercise: Helps regulate bowel function and reduce stress.
• Consistent meal times: Eating smaller, frequent meals may ease digestion.
3. Medications
Depending on symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend:
• Fiber supplements (e.g., psyllium) for constipation.
• Antispasmodics to reduce abdominal cramping.
• Laxatives or antidiarrheals for bowel regulation.
• Probiotics to support gut health.
• Low-dose antidepressants (e.g., tricyclics) to modulate pain signals.
4. Psychological Therapies
For some individuals, therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or gut-directed hypnotherapy can be effective in managing symptoms, especially when stress is a major trigger.

When to Seek Help
Consult a healthcare provider if:
• Symptoms are severe, persistent, or disrupt daily life.
• There is unexplained weight loss, fever, blood in stool, or family history of digestive diseases (to rule out other conditions).
