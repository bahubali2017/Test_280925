What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?
Definition:
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder. This means it affects how the gut works but does not cause visible damage to the digestive tract. It is characterized by a group of symptoms that occur together, often over a long period.

Key Features of IBS
1. Common Symptoms
• Abdominal pain or discomfort: Often relieved by passing stool.
• Altered bowel habits: This can include:
• Diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D)
• Constipation-predominant (IBS-C)
• Mixed pattern (IBS-M), alternating between diarrhea and constipation.
• Bloating and gas: A feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen.
• Changes in stool appearance: Mucus in stool or irregular consistency.
2. Triggers and Patterns
• Symptoms often fluctuate, with periods of flare-ups and remission.
• Common triggers include:
• Certain foods (e.g., high-fat meals, dairy, caffeine, artificial sweeteners).
• Stress and anxiety.
• Hormonal changes (e.g., during menstrual cycles).
3. Diagnosis
• There is no specific test for IBS. Diagnosis is usually based on:
• Symptom criteria (e.g., Rome IV criteria).
• Ruling out other conditions like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or infections through tests if needed.

Management Overview
Lifestyle and Dietary Adjustments
• Dietary changes:
• Identify and avoid trigger foods (e.g., via a food diary).
• Consider a low FODMAP diet (fermentable carbohydrates that can worsen symptoms), ideally under guidance.
• Increase fiber intake gradually for constipation-predominant IBS.
• Stress management:
• Techniques like mindfulness, yoga, or counseling can help reduce symptom severity.
• Regular exercise: Can improve bowel function and reduce stress.
Medications (if needed)
• Depending on symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend:
• Antispasmodics for abdominal pain.
• Laxatives for constipation or anti-diarrheals for diarrhea.
• Probiotics to support gut health.
• Low-dose antidepressants (for pain modulation in some cases).
When to Seek Help
• Consult a healthcare provider for:
• Persistent or worsening symptoms.
• Unexplained weight loss, blood in stool, fever, or severe pain (to rule out other conditions).
• Guidance on personalized management.
