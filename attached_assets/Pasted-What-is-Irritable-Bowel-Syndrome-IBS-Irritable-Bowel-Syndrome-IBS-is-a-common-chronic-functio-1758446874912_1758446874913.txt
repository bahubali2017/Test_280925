What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic functional disorder of the digestive system. It affects how the gut and brain work together, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. IBS does not cause permanent damage to the intestines or increase the risk of serious diseases like cancer, but it can significantly impact daily life.

Key Features of IBS
1. Symptoms
Common symptoms include:
• Abdominal pain or discomfort, often relieved by passing stool.
• Altered bowel habits: diarrhea, constipation, or alternating between both.
• Bloating and visible abdominal distension.
• Gas and flatulence.
• Mucus in the stool.
• A feeling of incomplete evacuation after bowel movements.
Symptoms can vary in severity and may be triggered by stress, certain foods, or hormonal changes.
2. Subtypes of IBS
Based on predominant symptoms, IBS is often categorized as:
• IBS-D: Diarrhea-predominant.
• IBS-C: Constipation-predominant.
• IBS-M: Mixed (alternating diarrhea and constipation).
3. Causes and Triggers
The exact cause is unknown, but contributing factors may include:
• Gut-brain axis dysfunction: Miscommunication between the brain and digestive system.
• Altered gut motility: Muscles in the intestines contracting too fast or too slowly.
• Visceral hypersensitivity: Increased sensitivity to pain or discomfort in the gut.
• Microbiome imbalance: Changes in gut bacteria.
• Food intolerances: Such as to lactose, gluten, or high-FODMAP foods.
• Stress and psychological factors: Anxiety or depression can worsen symptoms.

Management Overview
Managing IBS typically involves a combination of lifestyle adjustments, dietary changes, and sometimes medications. Here’s a general approach:
1. Dietary Modifications
• Identify trigger foods: Common triggers include spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and high-fat meals.
• Low-FODMAP diet: A temporary elimination diet under guidance to identify problematic carbohydrates.
• Fiber intake: Soluble fiber (e.g., oats, psyllium) may help with constipation; insoluble fiber might worsen symptoms for some.
• Hydration: Drink plenty of water, especially if diarrhea or constipation is present.
2. Lifestyle Adjustments
• Stress management: Techniques like mindfulness, yoga, or counseling can reduce symptom flare-ups.
• Regular exercise: Helps regulate bowel function and reduce stress.
• Eating habits: Eat smaller, frequent meals and chew food thoroughly.
3. Medications
Depending on symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend:
• Antispasmodics: To reduce abdominal cramping.
• Laxatives or antidiarrheals: For constipation or diarrhea.
• Probiotics: To support gut bacteria balance.
• Antidepressants: Low doses may help with pain modulation and gut-brain communication.
4. When to Seek Help
Consult a healthcare provider if:
• Symptoms are severe, persistent, or disrupt daily life.
• There is unintended weight loss, blood in stool, fever, or family history of digestive diseases (to rule out other conditions).

Important Note
IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other conditions (like celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease) should be ruled out first. A healthcare professional can provide personalized advice based on individual symptoms and health history.
