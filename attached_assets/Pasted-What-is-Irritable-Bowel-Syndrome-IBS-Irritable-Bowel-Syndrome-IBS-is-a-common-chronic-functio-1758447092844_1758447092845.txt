What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic functional disorder of the digestive system. It affects how the gut and brain work together, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. It is not a disease but a syndrome—a collection of symptoms—and does not cause permanent damage to the intestines or increase the risk of serious conditions like cancer.

Key Features of IBS
1. Symptoms
Common symptoms include:
• Abdominal pain or discomfort, often relieved by passing stool.
• Altered bowel habits: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C), or alternating between both (IBS-M).
• Bloating, gas, or a feeling of fullness.
• Changes in stool appearance: may be loose, hard, or contain mucus.
Symptoms often fluctuate—they may come and go, worsen with stress or certain foods, and vary in intensity.
2. Causes and Triggers
The exact cause is unknown, but contributing factors may include:
• Gut-brain axis dysfunction: miscommunication between the brain and digestive system.
• Visceral hypersensitivity: heightened sensitivity to pain or discomfort in the intestines.
• Changes in gut motility: abnormal contractions of intestinal muscles.
• Triggers: certain foods (e.g., high-FODMAP foods), stress, hormonal changes, or infections.
3. Diagnosis
IBS is typically diagnosed based on symptoms, as there is no specific test for it. Doctors may use criteria like the Rome IV criteria and rule out other conditions through:
• Medical history and symptom assessment.
• Blood tests, stool tests, or imaging if needed to exclude other issues.

Management Overview
Managing IBS focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. Approaches are often personalized:
1. Dietary Changes
• Identify trigger foods: Common triggers include dairy, caffeine, alcohol, and high-FODMAP foods (e.g., onions, garlic, beans).
• Fiber adjustment: Soluble fiber (e.g., oats, psyllium) may help; insoluble fiber (e.g., bran) might worsen symptoms for some.
• Low FODMAP diet: A short-term elimination diet under guidance to pinpoint triggers.
2. Lifestyle Modifications
• Stress management: Techniques like mindfulness, yoga, or counseling can help reduce symptom flare-ups.
• Regular exercise: Improves gut motility and overall well-being.
• Adequate hydration and meal timing: Eating smaller, frequent meals may help.
3. Medications
Depending on symptoms, a doctor may recommend:
• Antispasmodics: Reduce abdominal cramping.
• Laxatives or antidiarrheals: For constipation or diarrhea.
• Probiotics: May help balance gut bacteria.
• Low-dose antidepressants: Sometimes used for pain modulation or visceral hypersensitivity.
4. Psychological Support
For some, therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or gut-directed hypnotherapy can be beneficial.

When to Seek Help
Consult a healthcare provider if:
• Symptoms are severe, persistent, or disrupt daily life.
• There are "red flag" signs like unexplained weight loss, blood in stool, fever, or family history of digestive diseases.
