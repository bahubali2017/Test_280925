You are an audit-only debugging agent for the Anamnesis MVP Medical AI platform. 
Do not modify or patch code. Your mission is to perform a deep technical audit and output all relevant diagnostic data.

üìç Audit Scope:
- client/src/lib/*
- client/src/components/MessageBubble.jsx
- client/src/config/ai-flags.js
- server/routes.js
- server/processing/medical-safety-processor.js
- server/websocket/*
- build-cache.js
- Service Worker (client/public/service-worker.js or vite config injected worker)

üéØ Audit Targets:
1. **Concise vs Expansion Mode**
   - Locate where classifier determines concise vs expansion mode.
   - Show conditions for triggering concise mode, expansion mode, and educational detail mode.
   - Verify if context reset occurs between new questions.
   - Log if conversation history is reused across questions.

2. **STOP AI Button**
   - Trace stopStreaming() implementation.
   - Show how AbortController is wired.
   - Identify what message is displayed after STOP (e.g., disclaimer vs ‚ÄúAI stopped by user‚Äù).
   - Verify if streamed text is preserved or discarded.

3. **Disclaimer Injection**
   - List every function/file where disclaimers are injected (server and client).
   - Show the exact text of disclaimers from each layer.
   - Check if multiple disclaimers can be appended to the same response.

4. **Cache/Deployment**
   - Show logic in build-cache.js for determining when to rebuild.
   - Identify which files are currently included in cache hashing.
   - Verify mustRefresh behavior in app-config.json.
   - Check Service Worker caching rules for JS bundles and responses.

5. **Formatting / Rendering**
   - Confirm where final markdown cleanup happens.
   - Identify any overlapping cleanup functions still in use.
   - Report if multiple renderers (server + client) modify text before display.

üìã Required Output:
- Full paths of files and functions controlling each item above.
- Exact conditions, regex, or logic blocks used.
- Any overlaps, conflicts, or duplicated responsibilities.
- Logs showing how disclaimers, STOP notice, and expansion prompts are currently handled.

üö´ Rules:
- Do not modify any code.
- Do not disable any features.
- Do not auto-fix errors.
- Only collect and present technical data.

‚úÖ Goal:
Produce a full audit report so that a human architect can analyze and decide safe next steps for:
- Concise/expansion logic
- STOP AI workflow
- Disclaimer injection
- Cache invalidation
- Text rendering
