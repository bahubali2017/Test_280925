#### 5. ATD (Advice to Doctor) Router (`atd-router.js`)
- **Provider Routing Logic**: Emergency/urgent/routine classification
- **Structured Medical Data**: Provider-ready patient information
- **Clinical Flags**: Risk indicators for healthcare providers
- **Priority Scoring**: 1-10 urgency scoring system

### UI Safety Components

#### 1. FeedbackNotice Component (`FeedbackNotice.jsx`)
- **Multi-Type Notices**: General, emergency, mental health, medication
- **Emergency Contacts Display**: Region-specific emergency numbers
- **Recommended Actions**: Step-by-step user guidance
- **Professional Styling**: Color-coded safety alerts

#### 2. TriageWarning Component (`TriageWarning.jsx`)
- **Triage-Based Warnings**: Emergency/urgent/routine classifications
- **Interactive Emergency Calling**: Direct phone call functionality
- **Safety Flag Display**: Clinical risk indicators
- **Action Button Integration**: Emergency services access

### Integration Layer

#### Medical Safety Processor (`medical-safety-processor.js`)
Central orchestration system that:
- Processes all user input through safety pipeline
- Coordinates triage, emergency detection, and ATD routing
- Generates UI-ready safety notices and warnings
- Manages AI blocking decisions for high-risk situations
- Provides privacy-compliant logging and analytics

#### Enhanced LLM API (`llm-api-enhanced.jsx`)
Safety-integrated API wrapper that:
- Pre-processes all messages through safety framework
- Blocks AI responses for emergency situations
- Post-processes AI responses with safety filters
- Enhances responses with disclaimer enforcement
- Provides safety metadata for UI components

## Safety Framework Features

### 1. Conservative Triage Bias
- **Emergency Escalation**: Any ambiguous chest/breathing symptoms â†’ Emergency
- **Pediatric Safety**: Children's symptoms escalated one level higher
- **Geriatric Considerations**: Multiple symptoms in elderly â†’ Urgent
- **Mental Health Priority**: All crisis indicators â†’ Emergency level

### 2. Emergency Protocol System
- **Automatic Detection**: 25+ emergency symptom patterns
- **Crisis Intervention**: Suicidal ideation and self-harm detection
- **Regional Adaptation**: Country-specific emergency contacts
- **Immediate Action Plans**: Step-by-step emergency response

### 3. Diagnostic Boundary Enforcement
- **Language Filtering**: "You have" â†’ "You may be experiencing"
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Clear limitation statements
- **Professional Referral**: Automatic provider routing recommendations
- **Disclaimer Integration**: Mandatory medical disclaimers

### 4. Privacy & Ethics Compliance
- **PII/PHI Sanitization**: Automatic sensitive data removal
- **Anonymized Logging**: Analytics without patient data
- **HIPAA-Aligned Design**: Medical data handling compliance
- **Consent-Aware Processing**: User privacy protection
