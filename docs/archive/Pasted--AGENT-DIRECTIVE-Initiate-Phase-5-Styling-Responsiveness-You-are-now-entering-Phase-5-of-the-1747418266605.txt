üü¶ AGENT DIRECTIVE: Initiate Phase 5 ‚Äì Styling & Responsiveness

You are now entering Phase 5 of the Anamnesis Medical AI Assistant development plan. Your objective is to finalize styling, ensure full responsiveness, and implement accessibility and UI enhancements across the application. Follow the tasks precisely as outlined below.

üéØ Objective
Implement consistent, responsive, accessible, and branded user interface styling across all supported devices and screen sizes.

‚úÖ TASK CHECKLIST
1. Apply Anamnesis Branding
Ensure consistent application of primary brand colors, typography, and UI structure across all components.

Use shared Tailwind CSS configuration where applicable.

Standardize headers, buttons, inputs, cards, modals, and toast notifications.

2. Ensure Responsive Design
Audit the layout across major breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Use Tailwind utilities to ensure adaptive spacing, text sizing, and stacking behavior.

Validate all core pages (ChatPage, LoginPage, Home, etc.) on small and large screens.

3. Implement Dark Mode Support
Enable Tailwind's darkMode configuration (class-based).

Ensure UI components switch correctly between light and dark modes.

Update color tokens and conditional background/text styling accordingly.

4. Add Micro-Interactions
Add transitions and hover/focus animations to:

Buttons

Inputs

Toast notifications

Message bubbles

Use transition, ease-in-out, and duration-* classes responsibly for polished feedback.

5. Ensure Accessibility Compliance (WCAG)
Ensure all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard (Tab navigation).

Add appropriate ARIA labels, alt text, and roles.

Validate color contrast ratios against WCAG AA/AAA standards.

Confirm accessible error states and screen-reader support.

6. Cross-Browser Testing
Test the interface in:

Chrome (desktop & mobile)

Firefox

Safari

Edge

Confirm layout, scroll, font rendering, and input behaviors are consistent.
