✅ AGENT TASK DIRECTIVE — TypeScript Error Triage Baseline
OBJECTIVE:
You are instructed to analyze the full TypeScript error log located at ts-error-initial-full.log and generate a new triage summary file titled TS_ERROR_TRIAGE_SUMMARY.md.

📂 INPUT FILE
Use the file: ts-error-initial-full.log
This is located in the project root and contains all current TypeScript errors.

📌 OUTPUT FILE
Create: TS_ERROR_TRIAGE_SUMMARY.md

Place it in the root directory

This will serve as the authoritative checklist for all remaining TypeScript errors before final cleanup and stabilization.

📋 OUTPUT STRUCTURE
For each file in the log, follow this format:

## [relative/file/path.jsx]

**Error Count:** X  
**Error Codes:** [TSxxxx, TSyyyy, …]  
**Common Issues:**  
- ⛔ Missing type annotations  
- ⚠️ Implicit any / unknown  
- ❌ Props not destructured  
- 🧩 Import path issues (`@/lib/utils` not resolved)  
- 🔁 Invalid ref forwarding  
- 🧠 JSX children or context type mismatches  
- 🗃️ Misaligned Context.Provider typing

**Triage Category:**  
- [ ] ✅ UI Component (convert props + add JSDoc)
- [ ] 🔄 Convert to bridge wrapper (complex ref/context mismatch)
- [ ] 🧼 Simple Type Fixes (missing className/type/any)
- [ ] 🪛 JSX Root Element Typing (React.FC vs Element return)
- [ ] 🚨 Critical blocker (invalid module structure or missing file)

🔁 GROUPING & SUMMARY
At the bottom of the file, include:

# 🔢 Error Code Frequency Summary
- TS2339: 117 errors → Missing property on object
- TS7006: 42 errors → Implicit 'any' parameter
- TS2307: 18 errors → Cannot find module
- TS2322: 15 errors → Type mismatch
...

# 📊 Triage Category Count
- ✅ UI Component Fixes: 31 files
- 🔄 Bridge Conversion: 8 files
- 🧼 Minor Typing: 14 files
- 🚨 Blockers: 3 files

⛔ RESTRICTIONS
Do not attempt to fix errors in this task.
Do not skip any files.
Do not summarize or collapse errors — this must be exhaustive and file-specific.
Every file listed in the log must have a triage entry in TS_ERROR_TRIAGE_SUMMARY.md.

✅ GOAL
Once this file is created, it will be used to launch Final Phase: Targeted TypeScript Fixing — cleaning all remaining files with structured prompts.

Begin parsing ts-error-initial-full.log and create TS_ERROR_TRIAGE_SUMMARY.md now.
