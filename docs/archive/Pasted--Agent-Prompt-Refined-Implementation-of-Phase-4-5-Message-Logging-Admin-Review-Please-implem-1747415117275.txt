🛠️ Agent Prompt: Refined Implementation of Phase 4.5 – Message Logging & Admin Review
Please implement a lightweight and modular version of Phase 4.5 designed for MVP-level functionality while ensuring that all logging and review infrastructure is easily transferable to the future centralized admin dashboard.

✅ Adjusted Phase Objectives:
Focus on robust backend message logging with secure storage

Deprioritize building a full admin UI; instead, implement admin API endpoints and optionally a developer-only JSON viewer

Ensure user privacy compliance and export capabilities for preliminary QA/testing

All admin features must be modular and removable once connected to the main dashboard

🔐 Tasks: Logging & Storage (Required for MVP)
Create messages table in the database with:

id: UUID or auto-increment

user_id: FK to users table (can be mock/demo ID for MVP)

user_input: TEXT

ai_response: TEXT

timestamp: default now()

metadata: JSON (nullable; to store triage info, risk flags, etc.)

Implement logging in chat API pipeline:

Store each interaction when a response is completed

Include user_id, input text, final response, and metadata

Create helper module: lib/utils/message-logger.js

Exports logMessage({ userId, input, output, metadata })

Handles DB insert with retry logic and logging

🧑‍💻 Admin Interface (Optional but Recommended for Testing)
Create developer-only review endpoint (NO public UI):

/admin/messages: returns recent messages as JSON

Accepts query params: ?user=, ?limit=, ?riskOnly=true

Secured via simple token-based auth (e.g. process.env.ADMIN_KEY)

Export utility:

/admin/messages/export: returns CSV or JSONL for analysis

Only accessible by admin key

Includes headers like timestamp, user input, response, intent, triage level

🧾 Privacy Controls (Post-MVP Optional)
Basic opt-out support (optional):

POST /api/settings/privacy endpoint to toggle logging preference

Logged in-memory or in user profile object (if available)

Manual message deletion (optional):

DELETE /api/messages/:userId to clear message history on request

🧠 Suggestions / Adjustments
❗ Do NOT build a full admin dashboard UI here. Just create basic data access via secure endpoints.

✅ Keep storage and export modular so the main admin dashboard can later consume this via API or DB layer.

🚫 No need to build full analytics or charts in MVP; simply log and allow developer inspection.

📄 Make sure logging includes AI version/model used, processing time, and flags (e.g. isHighRisk) for QA.

📁 Required File Changes
server/storage/messages.js – CRUD functions for message logs

lib/utils/message-logger.js – Helper for logging

server/routes/admin-messages.js – Developer-only admin routes

db/schema.sql or equivalent schema migration

After implementing, update the following files:

DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md → mark logging completed

PHASE4_PROGRESS.md → mark Phase 4.5 subtasks

LAYER_PROGRESS.md → ensure message-level metadata is logged
