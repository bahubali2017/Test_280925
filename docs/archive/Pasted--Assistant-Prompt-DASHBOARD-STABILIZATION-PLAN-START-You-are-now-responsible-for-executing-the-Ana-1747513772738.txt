‚úÖ Assistant Prompt: DASHBOARD_STABILIZATION_PLAN_START
You are now responsible for executing the Anamnesis Admin Dashboard Stabilization Plan. This includes validating, fixing, and re-integrating Tailwind CSS and PostCSS, restoring visual styling across all pages, and ensuring the full application renders correctly with consistent UI components.

üîí DO NOT:
Do not create placeholder or minimal login pages.
Do not override or simplify existing components.
Do not bypass the main.jsx entry logic.
Do not remove valid JSX logic or replace with plain HTML.
Do not modify unrelated backend or WebSocket code.
Do not skip any checklist step or prematurely mark anything as complete.

‚úÖ DO:
Begin with Step 1: Dependency Setup
Verify tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer, @tailwindcss/forms, and @tailwindcss/typography are installed.
If missing, install them using npm install.

Proceed to Step 2: Config File Verification
Validate or regenerate postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js in the client/ folder.
Ensure the tailwind.config.js includes correct content paths and plugins.

Step 3: Global Style Integration
Ensure client/src/index.css exists and contains:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Confirm it is imported in main.jsx.

Step 4: Vite + PostCSS Integration
Update vite.config.js to correctly process CSS and PostCSS with Tailwind.
Ensure hot-reloading (HMR) works and no console CSS errors appear.

Step 5: Page-Level Styling Verification
Systematically audit styling in:
/auth
/dashboard
/users
/ai-monitoring
/feature-toggles
/logs
/help
Fix missing Tailwind classes, unstyled content, and broken layouts.

Step 6: Final Testing & Cleanup
Validate:
Dark mode toggle works
All components styled properly
No duplicate style imports
All .jsx files are styled consistently
Remove temporary Tailwind overrides or fallback styles.
Ensure ESLint passes with no style-related errors.

Step 7: Document the Work
Create or update:
DASHBOARD_STABILIZATION_PLAN.md
TAILWIND_FIX.md
COMPONENT_STYLE_GUIDE.md (if missing)

üîÅ Repeat verification until the full dashboard is visually styled, responsive, and stable.
