🛑 DO NOT PROCEED WITH ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT.

You must first document all errors, fixes, and lessons learned from today’s debugging session. Generate a markdown report titled:

📄 `/docs/reports/ERROR_FIX_REPORT_<today’s-date>.md`

This report must include:

---

## 1. 🔥 Summary of Critical Issues

Document each of the major problems encountered today, grouped by category:

- ✅ Server Run Failures:
  - Missing `dotenv` package
  - Deleted `index.ts`, `storage.ts`, `vite.ts`, `routes.ts` breaking server entry point
  - Misconfigured `MemStorage` import after TypeScript migration
  - Broken Supabase initialization (`undefined` WebSocket port)

- ✅ App Load Failures:
  - Login page rendering blank (white screen)
  - Missing React imports in multiple files (`App.jsx`, `ChatPage.jsx`, etc.)
  - Flickering Chat UI due to stuck pending state
  - ProtectedRoute crashing with `React is not defined`

---

## 2. 🛠️ Fixes Applied

For each issue, provide:

- ✅ **File Path(s)** (e.g. `server/index.js`, `src/components/ChatPage.jsx`)
- ✅ **Code Evidence**: show before/after code if relevant
- ✅ **Fix Description**: explain what was fixed and why
- ✅ **Validation**: how the fix was verified (e.g. test message sent, server started)

Example:

**Issue**: `MemStorage` not exported  
**Fix**: Removed broken import from `message-api.js`  
**Validation**: Server booted successfully and `/api/chat/stream` processed messages.

## 3. ⚙️ System Validation Steps

- Confirm the following endpoints work:
  - `GET /api/messages/:userId`
  - `POST /api/chat/stream`
- Confirm:
  - Server runs without crashing (`npm run dev`)
  - App loads login screen
  - After login, user is routed to ChatPage
  - Chat accepts input and streams response via SSE

## 4. 🧠 Lessons Learned & Architectural/Technical Debt (ATD)

Include insights such as:

- Agent deleted production-critical files due to missing validation.
- TypeScript file deletion caused runtime failures even though `.js` versions existed.
- Supabase misconfiguration caused invalid WebSocket URL construction.
- Over-reliance on the agent without pre-validation led to downtime.
- Recommendations: Manual validation **before** running file removal/refactor commands.
- Architectural TODO: Add CLI validation script before commit hooks.

## 5. ✅ Final Status Summary

List:
- Chat working ✅
- App loading ✅
- Login flow ✅
- Server stable ✅
- Streaming + suggested questions ✅
