‚úÖ OBJECTIVE
Restrict the agent from using any ESLint suppression comments and revert any existing suppression usage. Instead, the agent must identify and fix the root causes of the ESLint issues.

üß≠ YOUR NEXT STEPS
1. Search for Suppressions
Run the following in your Replit shell to find all instances of ESLint suppression:

grep -r --include="*.{js,jsx}" "eslint-disable" client/src
This will show which files contain suppression comments like:

// eslint-disable-line
/* eslint-disable */
/* eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars */

2. Create a Suppression Report
Use the output from the command above to create a file like:
ESLINT_SUPPRESSION_AUDIT.md
Example structure:

# ESLint Suppression Audit

The following files contain ESLint suppression comments that must be removed and replaced with proper code fixes:

- [ ] client/src/components/ui/button.jsx
- [ ] client/src/components/ui/sidebar.jsx
- [ ] client/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx

## Fix Plan
- Remove suppression comments
- Fix root issue (e.g., unused imports, missing JSDoc, invalid JSX)
- Verify ESLint passes with zero suppressions

3. Directive for the Agent
Use this prompt in your next Replit Agent instruction:

TASK: REMOVE ALL ESLINT SUPPRESSIONS

Objective: Ensure strict code quality by eliminating all ESLint suppression comments across the codebase.

Instructions:
1. Search all project files for any usage of `eslint-disable`, `eslint-disable-line`, or `eslint-disable-next-line`.
2. For each instance:
   - Remove the suppression comment
   - Identify the underlying issue that was suppressed
   - Apply the correct fix (e.g., remove unused variable, add missing JSDoc, restructure JSX)
3. Do not introduce any new ESLint suppressions under any circumstance.
4. For each file updated:
   - Run ESLint to confirm the issue is resolved
   - Update `migration-tracker.md` or `ESLINT_SUPPRESSION_AUDIT.md` to reflect the fix

‚ö†Ô∏è Absolutely **no `eslint-disable` comments are allowed going forward**. All code must pass ESLint cleanly by fixing issues directly.

Final Goal: `npx eslint client/ --ext .js,.jsx` returns **0 errors and 0 warnings**, with **no suppressions present in the codebase**.
