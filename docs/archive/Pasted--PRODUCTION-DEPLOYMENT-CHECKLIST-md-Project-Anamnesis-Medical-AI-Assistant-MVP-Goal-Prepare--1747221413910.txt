📦 PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
✅ Project: Anamnesis - Medical AI Assistant MVP
Goal: Prepare and verify all technical components for a live deployment to a secure, stable environment.

📁 1. Build & Environment Configuration
 Configure vite.config.js for production build mode

 Set base path correctly (e.g., '' or /) depending on hosting

 Create .env.production with:

VITE_API_BASE_URL

VITE_APP_NAME

VITE_ENV=production

 Ensure .env is not committed (.gitignore check)

 Verify Tailwind and shadcn/ui styles compile correctly in vite build

 Run:

bash
Zkopírovat
Upravit
npm run build
🔒 2. Security Hardening
 Ensure no mock authentication code is used in production (remove fallback login)

 Sanitize all user input (especially login/email forms)

 Disable console logging (or replace with Winston if needed)

 Verify no hardcoded API keys or secrets in the frontend

 Confirm CORS and headers setup in Express backend

🌐 3. Deployment Setup
 Choose hosting provider:

 Replit deployment OR

 Vercel/Netlify for frontend + Fly.io/Render for backend

 Add deployment secrets (API keys, DB URLs) in hosting environment

 Enable HTTPS / SSL where applicable

 Confirm backend endpoints (/api/llm, /auth, etc.) resolve correctly

 Use health check endpoint (/status or /ping) for server status

🧪 4. Final Testing
 Test login with demo credentials

 Submit an AI message and get a response

 Try accessing protected routes as guest (should redirect)

 Confirm favicon, title, and branding render properly

 Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

 Check metadata:

<meta name="description">

<title>

OpenGraph & social tags

✅ 5. Post-Deployment Final Checks
 Run full ESLint check again:

bash
Zkopírovat
Upravit
npx eslint client/ --ext .js,.jsx
 Ensure all .jsx files have valid JSX and no TypeScript leftovers

 Confirm absence of:

 @ts-ignore, eslint-disable, or commented-out code

 Placeholder UI components not wired to logic

 Check that ChatPage, LoginPage, and root navigation all work with zero runtime errors

 Verify favicon, logo, and app name show up in tab and social shares

🚀 6. Ready to Deploy
When all tasks are checked ✅:

 Push to production or main branch

 Trigger deployment build

 Test final production instance URL

 Monitor logs and usage (optional)
