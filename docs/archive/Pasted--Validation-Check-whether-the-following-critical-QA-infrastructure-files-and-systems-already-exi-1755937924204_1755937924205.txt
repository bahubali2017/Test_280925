🔍 Validation:

Check whether the following critical QA infrastructure files and systems already exist and are complete:

docs/LAYER_TEST_PLAN.md

Must include detailed test layer specifications for:

Metrics Evaluator

Feedback Handler

Improvement Suggester

Version Tracker

Integration QA Test Flow

Test Case Library

Confirm the presence of a well-structured directory or file that includes diverse medical triage test cases for:

Emergency

Urgent

Non-urgent

Mental health

Invalid/ambiguous entries

Automated Testing Logic

Check that all test cases have:

Expected outcome assertions

Simulated input scenarios

Logging of failed cases with detailed error context

Regression Test Suite

Ensure there's a mechanism to re-run critical cases after each model or logic update.

Must include detection for changes in triage behavior.

✅ If Missing or Incomplete:

Perform the following:

📄 1. Create docs/LAYER_TEST_PLAN.md

Structure:

## QA Layer Test Plan

### 1. Metrics Evaluator
- Test: Accuracy calculation from triage logs
- Input: [TP, TN, FP, FN sets]
- Expected: Precision, recall, F1 scores

### 2. Feedback Handler
- Test: Feedback with all valid/invalid user fields
- Input: JSON with query, accuracy, type
- Expected: Validation and storage

...

🧪 2. Create Test Case Library

File: client/src/tests/qa/test-cases.json or similar

Include at least 10 real-world test cases covering emergency, urgent, non-urgent, and safety edge cases.

⚙️ 3. Implement Automated Test Executor

Add a test runner that:

Loads test cases

Feeds them into the QA pipeline

Verifies output matches expected triage levels and responses

Reports failures with meaningful logs

♻️ 4. Add Regression Suite to QA Test Runner

Ensure qa.test.js or a new test runner supports rerunning all historical test cases to detect unexpected changes.

Output: pass/fail summary + diff in output if any behavior changes

✅ Confirm completion of all the above and provide summary with:

✅ Test file locations

✅ docs/LAYER_TEST_PLAN.md preview

✅ Pass rate from current test run
