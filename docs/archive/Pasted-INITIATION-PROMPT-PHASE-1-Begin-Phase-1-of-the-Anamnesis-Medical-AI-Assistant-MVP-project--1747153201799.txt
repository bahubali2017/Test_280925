INITIATION PROMPT – PHASE 1

Begin Phase 1 of the Anamnesis – Medical AI Assistant MVP project.

The objective is to set up the full project structure using **modern JavaScript (ESM)**, with no TypeScript, and prepare the foundation for a clean, well-documented UI.

🛑 Do not use TypeScript.  
✅ Use JavaScript with **JSDoc annotations** where needed.  
✅ Ensure the code is fully **ESLint compliant** from the start.

---

🎯 Phase 1 Objective:
Set up the project structure and initialize the frontend for Anamnesis - Medical AI Assistant MVP with:

- Vite + React (JavaScript)
- Tailwind CSS (with custom theme)
- ESLint (strict config, no disables)
- Wouter (for routing)
- Folder structure for components, pages, hooks, lib

---

📁 Folder Structure to Scaffold:
- `/client/`
  - `index.css` (global CSS, pasted below)
  - `/components/`
  - `/pages/` → with `LoginPage.js` and `ChatPage.js`
  - `/hooks/`
  - `/lib/`
  - `/assets/`

---

🧩 Tailwind Setup:
Use this exact Tailwind configuration and global CSS from the Anamnesis project to match styling and theme.

✅ `tailwind.config.ts` and `index.css` are already provided and imported.

🌀 Tailwind should include:
- HSL-based token system
- Animations (`accordion-up/down`)
- Responsive container utilities (`container-md`, `container-lg`)
- WCAG-compliant accessibility styles

---

🔧 Tasks:
- Scaffold Vite React app in JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- Configure Tailwind with provided config
- Install and configure ESLint for JavaScript + React
- Add Wouter and set up basic routing (`/login`, `/chat`)
- Create empty `LoginPage.js` and `ChatPage.js`
- Convert any existing TypeScript schemas to JSDoc typedefs in `lib/types.js`

---

✅ Completion Criteria:
- Project structure is correctly set up
- Tailwind config and CSS are working
- ESLint passes with **no warnings or errors**
- Routing works and pages render cleanly
- All files are in **JavaScript with JSDoc**

DO NOT implement logic yet — this phase is only for scaffold and environment setup.
