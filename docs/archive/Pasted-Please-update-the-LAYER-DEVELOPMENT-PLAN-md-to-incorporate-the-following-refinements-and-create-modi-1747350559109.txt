Please update the LAYER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md to incorporate the following refinements and create/modify the necessary code files accordingly. These tasks should be added as sub-tasks within existing phases, without creating new top-level phases.

📁 Phase 0.1 – Infrastructure Hardening (inserted before Phase 1)
Tasks to Add:

 Create validateLayerContext() helper inside lib/layer-context.js

Validates required fields: userInput, intent, symptoms, triage, etc.

Ensures schema consistency across all layer phases

 Add lib/utils/schema-validator.js for cross-phase type safety enforcement

🧠 Phase 1 – Intent Recognition (additional NLP sub-tasks)
Tasks to Add:

 Create lib/nlp/negation-detector.js

Parses common negation terms (e.g., "no", "not", "without", "never")

Adds a negated: true flag to affected symptoms or conditions

 Update intent-parser.js to call negation-detector during symptom extraction

 Add test cases for phrases like:

"No fever"

"I’m not diabetic"

"Never had chest pain"

🧩 Phase 3 – Prompt Engineering (enhance prompt-tier system)
Tasks to Add:

 Create 3 severity-specific prompt templates:

mild-template.txt

moderate-template.txt

severe-template.txt

 Modify prompt-enhancer.js to select the appropriate template based on:

Triage level (e.g., "urgent", "non-urgent")

Symptom severity (LayerContext.severity)

 Add inline logic for conditional template injection into system prompts

📊 Phase 5 – Metadata & Outcome Logging (enhance data logger)
Tasks to Add:

 In utils/data-logger.js, add:

finalPrompt string

LLMResponseCategory enum: "educational", "generic", "flagged", "fallback"

 Modify logging output in router.js to include these fields in JSON logs

 Create unit tests to verify proper metadata logging

⚠️ Phase 6 – Fault Recovery
Tasks to Add:

 Implement try/catch block in sendMessageClientSide() or router.js:

On error, bypass the layer and send raw query directly to the LLM

Display fallback disclaimer in UI: "The enhanced AI layer encountered an issue. Here's a direct response:"

 Log fallback reason and timestamp in data-logger.js

🧪 Phase 7 – Visual Trace Debugging
Tasks to Add:

 Create /admin/debug/:sessionId endpoint

Displays: parsed intent → triage → generated prompt → LLM output

Pulls session data from the training-dataset/ folder or live cache

 Use server-side rendering or basic HTML+JSON viewer

 Add link in admin panel for quick access during QA

🧰 Additional Notes
Use JSDoc annotations in all new helper modules

All enhancements must pass ESLint and follow modular structure

Include updates to docs/LAYER_TEST_PLAN.md and LAYER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md for each task added

✅ Confirm each enhancement is implemented and logged in LAYER_PROGRESS.md.
