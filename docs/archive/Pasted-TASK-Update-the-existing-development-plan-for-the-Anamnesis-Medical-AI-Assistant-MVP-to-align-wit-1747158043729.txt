TASK: Update the existing development plan for the Anamnesis – Medical AI Assistant MVP to align with real-world deployment objectives.

🎯 New Goal:
Evolve the MVP from a frontend-only prototype into a **fully functional MVP+** that supports real user registration, persistent sessions, message logging, and traffic analytics. This MVP is intended for live user testing and lead generation.

🛠️ Tech Scope Update:
Add lightweight backend infrastructure using Supabase or Firebase for authentication, database, and analytics.

📋 Modify the development plan (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) to include:

---

✅ Updated MVP Scope & Vision:
- Support real user **sign-up**, **login**, and **session persistence**
- Store user information securely in a managed database
- Log AI interactions (prompt/response pairs) per user
- Enable lead tracking and usage monitoring for growth and iteration
- Keep codebase in **JavaScript** with `.tsx` files and **JSDoc annotations**
- Maintain clean ESLint compliance throughout

---

🧱 Add New Phase(s) to Development Plan:

**Phase 2.5 – Backend Integration & Real Authentication**

**Objective:** Replace mock authentication with real user auth and connect to a managed database.

**Tasks:**
- Choose and configure backend service: Supabase (preferred) or Firebase
- Set up database schema for:
  - Users
  - Sessions
  - Messages (optional)
- Replace `useAuth.tsx` logic with real Supabase/Firebase integration
- Update `login()` and `signup()` to hit real auth API
- Add new user registration form logic
- Persist session tokens in localStorage
- Add error handling and feedback for login failures
- Secure routes using token/session checks
- Add JSDoc annotations for all changes

**Completion Criteria:**
- Users can register and log in with real credentials
- Session is maintained between reloads
- Chat interface only loads for logged-in users
- ESLint passes with no errors
- JSDoc annotations are complete

---

🔐 Additional Enhancements:
- Add “Sign up” / “Log in” toggle to login page
- Add legal disclaimer text below form (about AI usage, medical info, etc.)
- Track leads (registered emails) for future contact

---

📦 Optional Future Phase: Message Logging & Admin Review (Phase 4.5)
- Store chat messages per user in backend
- Export logs or provide admin interface for future analysis

---

✅ Final Instructions:
Update `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` to reflect this revised, deployment-ready MVP+ plan. Do not implement anything yet — only update the plan with this new scope and roadmap.
