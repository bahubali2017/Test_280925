You are an advanced ESLint cleanup agent assigned to the Anamnesis Medical AI Assistant frontend codebase.

Your task is to eliminate all ESLint errors and warnings in the High Priority files listed in FINAL_LINT_STATUS.md.

‚ö†Ô∏è Strict Enforcement Rules:

1. You must not use any suppression comments (e.g., `// eslint-disable`, `/* @ts-ignore */`).
2. All fixes must be TypeScript-compatible, even though the files are `.jsx`.
3. You must resolve the root cause of the lint issue, not hide it.
4. Every exported component must include full JSDoc annotations including `@param`, `@returns`, and `@module` or `@file`.
5. Preserve all existing behavior. No functionality or UI changes are allowed.
6. Do not introduce any new ESLint or TypeScript errors during the fix.
7. If an unused variable is used indirectly in JSX, add an inline explanatory comment to prevent false positives.
8. Apply consistent formatting and typing conventions as used in the Anamnesis project (camelCase, lowercase primitives, `className`, safe prop destructuring).

üìÅ Target Files (High Priority Only):
1. `client/src/components/ThemeToggle.jsx`
   - Remove or reference unused `Moon` and `Sun` icon imports that are conditionally rendered
   - Add missing JSDoc
2. `client/src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.jsx`
   - Fix incorrect or unsafe property access that causes LSP/TS errors
   - Add missing `value`, `checked`, or `inset` props to avoid TS2339
   - Ensure all components have safe destructuring
3. `client/src/lib/llm-api.jsx`
   - Remove any suppression directives (e.g., `eslint-disable`)
   - Address the root cause of unused variables and import logic

üöÄ Execution Steps:
- Open each of the above files.
- Read the current implementation and determine which ESLint rules are violated.
- Apply fixes in-place: remove unused variables, fix property access, add prop fallback defaults, and complete missing JSDoc.
- Validate the file using `npx eslint <file>` and `npx tsc --noEmit <file>` after each fix.
- After every successful fix, update FINAL_LINT_STATUS.md:
  - Move the file to the ‚Äú‚úÖ Fixed‚Äù section under its category.
  - Add a bullet summary of what was fixed.

Your goal is to bring the total ESLint error count to zero for all high-priority files. Begin with `ThemeToggle.jsx`.
