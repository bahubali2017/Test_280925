## Using This Development Plan

This checklist-formatted plan can be used throughout the development process:

1. **Progress Tracking**: Check off items as they are completed using the checkboxes
2. **Phased Development**: Focus on completing one phase before moving to the next
3. **Collaboration**: Share progress with team members by updating the checklist
4. **Quality Assurance**: Use completion criteria to verify each phase is properly finished

When checking off items:
- Replace `- [ ]` with `- [x]` to mark a task as completed
- Add comments or notes next to items as needed for context
- Review completion criteria at the end of each phase before proceeding

**Active Tracking Files**:
- `PHASE4_PROGRESS.md` - Tracks current Phase 4 implementation progress
- `migration-tracker.md` - Monitors TypeScript to JavaScript migration status
- `ESLINT_SUPPRESSION_AUDIT.md` - Monitors ESLint suppression comments removal
- `ESLINT_ERRORS_LIST.md` - Documents and tracks all current ESLint issues

This development plan provides a structured approach to building the Anamnesis Medical AI Assistant MVP while ensuring high-quality, well-documented JavaScript code.
