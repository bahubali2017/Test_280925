# Phase 4 Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of Phase 4 implementations for the Anamnesis Medical AI Assistant.

## Phase 4.5 - Message Logging & Admin Review API (✅ Implemented)

### Completed Tasks

1. **Backend Message Logging System**
   - ✅ Added metadata field to message schema for enhanced data collection
   - ✅ Created message logger utility for tracking conversation data
   - ✅ Implemented session and risk tracking in message metadata
   - ✅ Added device and context information collection

2. **Admin API Endpoints**
   - ✅ Created secure `/admin/messages` endpoint for retrieving message logs
   - ✅ Implemented `/admin/messages/export` endpoint for data exports (CSV/JSONL)
   - ✅ Added ADMIN_KEY environment variable security
   - ✅ Built filtering capability for high-risk message identification

3. **Security & Best Practices**
   - ✅ Implemented token-based admin authentication
   - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and validation
   - ✅ Created standardized response formats for all admin endpoints
   - ✅ Deferred visual admin dashboard to post-MVP phase

### Technical Notes
- All admin functionality is API-only with no frontend UI implementation
- Admin API requires a valid ADMIN_KEY environment variable
- Focus on secure, robust backend implementation that can be integrated with admin dashboard post-MVP

## Phase 4.1 – AI Chat Enhancements (✅ Completed)

### Completed Tasks

1. **Prompt Engineering Layer**
   - ✅ Refactored prompt templates for better medical specificity
   - ✅ Added system role instructions to steer tone, disclaimers, and safety
   - ✅ Implemented dynamic tone adaptation for different query types
   - ✅ Added support for chronic condition and prevention queries

2. **Medical Disclaimers & Intent Detection**
   - ✅ Added disclaimers for all high-risk responses
   - ✅ Implemented rule-based checks for emergency symptoms
   - ✅ Added detection for off-topic use and PII
   - ✅ Implemented mental health crisis detection
   - ✅ Added context-aware follow-up suggestions

3. **Message Grouping & Layout**
   - ✅ Enhanced visual grouping of back-and-forth messages
   - ✅ Added visual cues for message sequence position
   - ✅ Improved message bubble styling for better readability

4. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - ✅ Created helper functions for metadata extraction
   - ✅ Implemented standardized disclaimer handling
   - ✅ Added consistent response metadata formatting
   - ✅ Built robust retry logic with exponential backoff
   - ✅ Refactored API functions to use helpers
   - ✅ Improved error handling with standardized formats

## Phase 4.2 – Live AI Response Enhancements (✅ Completed)

### Current Focus

We have successfully completed Phase 4.2 implementation, including streaming responses, enhanced message status indicators, and improved input handling with character counting and enter key behavior. All planned features for Phase 4.2 have been implemented.

### Tasks in Progress

1. **Streaming Responses**
   - ✅ Implemented character-by-character streaming with server-sent events
   - ✅ Added progressive message rendering to MessageBubble.jsx
   - ✅ Created fallback mechanism for interrupted streaming
   - ✅ Implemented cursor animation for typing simulation
   - ✅ Added server-side streaming endpoint support

2. **Retry Experience & Message Status**
   - ✅ Added visual indicators for message status (pending, delivered, failed)
   - ✅ Improved retry UI with streaming support
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling for streaming messages
   - ✅ Implemented consistent status transitions

3. **Input Enhancements**
   - ✅ Implemented Enter/Shift+Enter behavior for message submission
   - ✅ Added character counter with visual feedback (changes color as limit approaches)
   - ✅ Set character limit to prevent overly long messages
   - ✅ Added prevention of empty message submission
   - ✅ Improved input component with better focus management

### Technical Notes

- All implementations use JavaScript with JSDoc annotations
- No ESLint disable directives are being used
- Focus is on keeping the chat experience lightweight and responsive

## Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes

1. **Resolved Chat Response HTML Injection Bug** (Fixed on May 15, 2025)
   - ✅ Fixed critical issue where chat API was returning HTML instead of JSON responses
   - ✅ Updated Express middleware order to ensure API routes are registered before Vite
   - ✅ Added content type validation to detect and reject unexpected HTML responses
   - ✅ Improved error handling with detailed logging of response content types
   - ✅ ESLint error audit completed and documented in ESLINT_ERRORS_LIST.md
   - ✅ Enhanced client-side fetch with proper headers and error reporting

2. **Fixed SSE Chunk Display in Chat UI** (Fixed on May 15, 2025)
   - ✅ Resolved issue where raw "event: chunk" and "event: done" lines were visible in the frontend chat UI
   - ✅ Refactored streaming handler in llm-api.jsx to properly parse SSE events and extract text chunks
   - ✅ Implemented proper text accumulation for smooth rendering of streamed responses
   - ✅ Added metadata extraction from "done" event to display accurate response time
   - ✅ Ensured proper blinking cursor animation during streaming to indicate active typing
   - ✅ Tested with various medical queries to ensure proper streaming display

3. **Enhanced AI Response Generation** (Fixed on May 15, 2025)
   - ✅ Fixed issue where the AI was responding with a generic message regardless of query specifics
   - ✅ Added comprehensive condition detection for various health concerns (back pain, joint pain, etc.)
   - ✅ Implemented better symptom recognition logic using symptom terms and body part detection
   - ✅ Expanded medical response templates to cover a wider range of health topics
   - ✅ Improved response quality with structured format (causes, symptoms, management, disclaimer)
   - ✅ Added mental health response templates with appropriate guidance and resources
