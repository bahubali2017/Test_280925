# JavaScript Migration & Error Remediation Tracker

This document tracks the migration of TypeScript files (`.ts` and `.tsx`) to JavaScript files with JSDoc annotations (`.js` and `.jsx`) in the Anamnesis Medical AI Assistant MVP project.

## Migration Requirements

- Convert all TypeScript files to JavaScript

## Notes on Migration Process

1. File pairs (like llm-api.ts and llm-api.js) should be evaluated to determine which to keep
2. Always prioritize preserving functionality during migration
3. Migrate in small batches, testing thoroughly between each step
4. Run ESLint frequently to catch issues early
5. Handle cases where TypeScript interfaces may need to be replaced with JSDoc typedef comments
6. Be particularly careful with React components that rely on typed props
7. Add JSDoc comments describing component props, function parameters, and return types
